  6. Validation and evaluation of machine learning
6. **UNIT 6 CAPSTONE PROJECT**
  1. Project: The project is designed to provide with the experience of working in a realistic data science scenario.:+1:
  2. From the start to the finish, the project will be targeted to a specific client (real or imaginary). 
  3. Using the data science techniques that have learned, will not only come up with a reasonable solution to the problem, but learn to present it to them as a compelling story.
