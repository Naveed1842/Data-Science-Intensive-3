SSH Help Tips:
1. Procedure to follow when generate ssh key and put on GitHub

2. How to Review your SSH keys?
Version 1: Which does not work for me.
# Find and take a note of your public key fingerprint. 
# If you're using OpenSSH 6.8 or newer: ssh-add -l -E md5
# If you're using OpenSSH 6.7 or older:
$ eval "(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add -l

# $ echo $?  will tell if the previous command run successfully: if 0 # means success otherwise not success.

Version 2: Which works.
ls -l ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
$ ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/github_rsa.pub
# one kind of format
$ ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/github_ras.pub -E md5
# another format

3. Other things to know:
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
